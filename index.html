      <h4>About me:</h4>
      <p>
        I was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas, and got my start in show business with a two-year run on the kids show Barney and Friends. After a few bit parts in movies, I guest starred on the Disney Channel's The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Hannah Montana. In 2007, I was cast as the lead for Wizards of Waverly Place, and in 2009 I released the pop album Kiss & Tell. Other projects over the years include the 2013 film Spring Breakers and the 2015 album Revival, featuring the single "Good for You." I have also earned praise for going public with my battle with lupus.
